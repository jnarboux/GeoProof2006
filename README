This is the README file from project GeoProof, version 0.5

DESCRIPTION

This program is an interactive geometry software similar to Cabri
Geometre,GeoPlan, Kig... 
It contains automated theorem proving features.
Interactive theorem proving is in development.
To use the features related to Coq, you need Coq version 8.1 beta or later.

INSTALLATION

See the INSTALL file.

FEATURES

GeoProof features :

- five types of geometric objects : points, lines, circles, vectors and segments
- three transformations : central symetry, translation, and axial symetry
- nine ways to build a point : 
  - free point
  - point on circle
  - point on line
  - point on segment
  - point on half plane
  - midpoint 
  - point at intersection of 
    - two lines
    - one line and one circle
    - two circles
- five ways to build a line
  - line passing by two points
  - perpendicular line
  - parallel line
  - perpendicular bissector
  - angle bissector	
- three ways to build a circle
  - by center and a point
  - using a diameter
  - by three points	
- text labels
- three measures :
  - distances
  - angles
  - areas	
- eight labels for property tests :
  - collinearity
  - point equality
  - orthognality
  - parallelism
  - between
  - congruence of angles
  - congruence of distances
  - left-turn

- Automatic theorem proving capability

- GeoProof can read :
 - our own Xml based format (.drg)	
 - a description in pseudo natural language
 - a description of a theorem
 - Kig (.kig) files (partialy)
 - Car (.zir) files (partialy)

- GeoProof can export to :
 - SVG
 - PNG
 - BMP
 - JPG
 - Latex

- objects attributs : color, style, width and visibility
- layers that can be displayed independantly, can be visible or hiden and can have a color
- zoom in,out, to fit
- unlimited undo and redo
- fullscreen mode
- selection of objects by type or visibility
- options : toolbars visibility and default styles and colors
- internationalization  : GeoProof is available in french and english. (currently disabled)
