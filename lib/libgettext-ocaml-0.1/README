libgettext-ocaml.
--------------

This library is a wrapper around gettext 
( http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html ).

The primary target of this work is to bring internationalization to 
cameleon ( http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/cameleon/ ). Before i 
can do it, i need to test and test this library... ( so i package it
and try to use it with some program of my creation... ).

Feel free to use it in your application. There is no real doc coming
with it, but i will prepare some in the next future. 

There is a patch to apply against gettext, in order to have xgettext
work with ocaml source ( i try it, and it seems to work ).

Warning : if you use xgettext patched YOU NEED CLEAN SOURCE, in other
word, don't forget to pass camlp4 on your source to remove any special
syntax...

Please report me any problem : send an email to submit@bugs.gallu.homelinux.org
beginning with 

Package: libgettext-ocaml
Version: 0.1
Severity: { choose wishlist,normal,important }

and the description of your bugs.
